// 1. Write a JavaScript class named Rectangle that has two properties, width and height, initialized through its constructor. 
//    Then, instantiate an object of Rectangle with a width of 5 and a height of 10.

class Rectangle {
    constructor(width, height) {
        this.width = width
        this.height = height
    }

    calculateArea() {
        let area = this.height * this.width
        return area
    }
}

const new_rectangle_object = new Rectangle(5, 10)
console.log(new_rectangle_object)

// 2. How do you create a constructor within a class named Circle that initializes a property radius and sets its value based 
//    on the argument passed when a new Circle instance is created? Create an instance of Circle with a radius of 4.

class Circle {
    constructor(radius) {
        this.radius = radius
    } calculateArea(){
        let area = this.height * this.weight
        return area
    }
}

const new_circle = new Circle(4)
console.log(new_circle)

// 3. Explain how you would add a method named calculateArea to the Rectangle class that calculates the area of the rectangle. 
//    How does this method get added to the prototype of the class, and how can all instances of Rectangle access it?

console.log(new_rectangle_object.calculateArea())

// 4. In the context of a class method in JavaScript, what does the this keyword refer to, and how would you use it inside a method named describe in a class Person to access the instance's properties named name and age?

class Person {
    constructor(name, age) {
        this.name = name
        this.age = age
    }

    describe() {
        console.log('The name is ' + this.name + ' and the age is ' + this.age)
    }
}

const my_new_person = new Person('james', 27)
my_new_person.describe()
const my_second_person = new Person('rebecca', 25)
my_second_person.describe()

// 5. Create a class named Animal with a constructor that initializes a property species. Then, define a subclass named Dog that inherits from Animal and adds an additional property name in its constructor. How do instances of Dog access methods defined on Animal's prototype?

class Animal {
    constructor(species) {
        this.species = species
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    constructor(species, breed) {
        super(species)
        this.breed = breed
    }
}

const pepper = new Dog('doggie', 'chihuahua')
console.log(pepper)
